### About me

Gene is a designer, researcher and software developer who specialises computational design, digital fabrication in architecture and visual computing in computer science.

In 2013, he graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Taiwan Tamkang University, earning the Best Project Award for Undergraduate Design Thesis and the Excellent Performance Award of Overall Academic Performance. In 2016, he obtained a Master of Science degree from Stuttgart University,  [Integrative Technologies and Architectural Design Research](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/study/study-programs/Integrative-Technologies-and-Architectural-Design-Research-ITECH-M.Sc-00002./) ([ITECH](https://icd.uni-stuttgart.de/?p=6111)), and his master's thesis titled "[Assembly-Aware Design of Masonry Shell Structures: A Computational Approach](https://www.geneatcg.com/assembly-aware-design-of-masonry-shell-structures-a-computational-approach/)," supervised by Prof. Jan Knippers ([ITKE](https://www.itke.uni-stuttgart.de/)) and Prof. Achim Menges ([ICD](https://icd.uni-stuttgart.de/)), was presented in the Pecha Kucha plenary session in IASS 2017 in Hamburg. During his master study, Gene participated in the computational design group of the [ICD/ITKE Research Pavilion 2015-16](https://boty.archdaily.com/us/2017/candidates/103332/icd-itke-research-pavilion-2015-16-icd-itke-university-of-stuttgart), which has been selected as the winner of the 2017 ArchDaily BUILDING OF THE YEAR Award in the Small Scale Architecture category.

From 2013 to 2014, Gene worked as a research and teaching assistant at the [Digital Design & Fabrication LAB](https://www.facebook.com/digitalaieou/) ([CCC Lab](https://labccc.wordpress.com/)), Tamkang University under the supervision of Prof. Chen Chen-Cheng. From 2016 to 2018 he was a software developer at Ed. [Ed. ZÃ¼blin AG](https://www.zueblin.de/databases/internet/_public/content30.nsf/web30?Openagent&id=EN-ZUEBLIN.DEN_welcome.html) / [Strabag AG](https://www.strabag.com/) where he focused on research & development, innovation and software development for various construction and national wise research projects.

Gene strongly believes multidisciplinary research boosts innovation. By combining his research interests in the field of architectural design and computer science, Gene has developed many open-source projects. He loves programming, mathematics, geometry, and currently studies Computer Science [CAS](https://inf.ethz.ch/continuing-education/certificate-program.html) degree at ETH Zurich, focusing on [Visual Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_computing).

Gene is a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Technology in Architecture](https://ita.arch.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), where he is a research assistant in the [Block Research Group](http://www.block.arch.ethz.ch/brg/) and [NCCR Digital Fabrication](http://www.dfab.ch/), supervised by [Prof. Philippe Block](https://block.arch.ethz.ch/brg/people/philippe-block) and co-supervised by [Prof. Stelian Coros](http://crl.ethz.ch/coros.html).
