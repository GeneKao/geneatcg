message:

This is an example of a 404 page.

You can customize its title, message, and background image, and apply a fade-out effect to the latter.
It won't appear in the navbar (or direct navigation or queries, assuming you include ``_discoverable: no`` in its ``contents.lr``), and you'll need to create it manually see see it appear in the admin UI.
If not setup with Lektor, your server/host's default 404 page will be used.
